Overview
--------
Set of gerrit hooks that will update JIRA issues referenced in the subject of any changes.  Currently has hooks for change-abandoned,
change-merged, patchset-created.

This set of code is based off of the original jerrit code released by hobbs, see https://github.com/hobbs/jirret

The primary difference between this version and upstream is that this version aims to support several different jira instances
simultanioulsy from a single gerrit install by having a seperate configuration file per project.

Please note these scripts are still work in progress and have yet to be tested.

More info on hooks at:
http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.5/config-hooks.html

Requirements
------------
 - The user that runs the gerrit process must be able to ssh into the gerrit sshd to run "gerrit query" commands.  
 - JIRA must have xmlrpc enabled ( http://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRADEV/JIRA+XML-RPC+Overview )
 - Gerrit must have the canonicalWebUrl setup in order to add links to the change - see http://gerrit-documentation.googlecode.com/svn/Documentation/2.5/config-gerrit.html#_a_id_gerrit_a_section_gerrit

Installation Steps
-------------------
 - Drop hook files into $site_path/hooks 
 - Create JIRA user to post gerrit comments.  User should only need permissions to post new comments to issues
 - Setup config file in the home folder for the user that runs gerrit: ~/.jirretconfig

Config file
------------
jirret looks for a config file at ~/.jirretconfig_<GERRIT_PROJECT_NAME>

Where <GERRIT_PROJECT_NAME> is the name that gerrit uses to identify a given project.

See jirretconfig.example for an example.

Known issues/limitations
-------------------------
 - Still untested :-)
